    <p>Ethiopian culture is a rich tapestry of ancient traditions, strong family ties, and deep spirituality. One of the most iconic aspects is the traditional coffee ceremony, a symbol of hospitality and friendship. This ritual, involving the roasting, grinding, and brewing of coffee beans, is a time-honored practice that brings people together. Meals in Ethiopia often revolve around "injera," a sourdough flatbread made from teff, and shared communally, reflecting the importance of unity and togetherness in Ethiopian society.</p>
